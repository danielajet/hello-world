===============

The first task on my CS50 journey. 

I first heard about CS50 through one of Nas Daily's 1 minute videos. 
I thought the course and the whole ethos behing is and edX is amazing.
Give the situation I was in with regard to my university at the time I thought it would be a great idea to enroll and study something that I thought was cool and that is extremely relevant in this day and age.
